n3xqzt6,1m3m7z9,t3_1m3m7z9,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; For the first time in the history of US spot-crypto ETFs, Ethereum ETFs surpassed Bitcoin ETFs in daily inflows.

Ethereum-specific factors, such as high staking yields and potential SEC approval for staking-enabled ETFs, are driving demand. This marks a significant shift in the crypto ETF market, traditionally dominated by Bitcoin.

Atkins believes asset tokenization is inevitable and expressed optimism about the industry's future. He emphasized the importance of proper guidelines and disclosures while promoting blockchain and crypto technologies for financial infrastructure improvements. Atkins' pro-crypto stance contrasts with his predecessor, Gary Gensler.
